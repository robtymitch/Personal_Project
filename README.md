# Landlord/Tenant Application
PHP Indvidual Project
This project uses: 
-PHP 
-Object-Oriented Programing 
-HTML 
-CSS 
-AJAX/JQUERY 
-MySQL
-PHPmyAdmin 
and an API. 

It demonstrates a rough idea (outline) of how a Landlord can manage its users/tenants, by adding new tenants, managing their billing, creating/modify/delete work orders, or to delete/move them from the system.
It allows a user to create a profile or for an admin to add a user.
It uses a login system via POST for security. It uses sessions to log in to the correct profile, either as a admin or regular user. 
It also uses PHPmyAdmin database to manage the data such as names, profile information, email, apartment numbers, and safley hashes the passwords.
